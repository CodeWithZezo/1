      {
        question: "Are the results intended to replace clinical judgment?",
        answer:

      {
        question: "How do you handle maximum dose limits and rounding?",
        answer:

      },
      {
        question: "What should I do if a calculator output looks unexpected?",
        answer:

      },
      {
        question: "Can I change safety defaults like max doses?",
        answer:
          "Some calculators allow configurable settings. Changes are clearly marked and session-based. Verify any custom values against trusted references."
